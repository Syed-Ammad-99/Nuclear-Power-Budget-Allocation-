Pakistan spends 1/5 of its budget on defense—highest among nuclear states

This pie chart reveals a striking disparity in how top nuclear-armed states allocate their government budgets to defense. Here’s what stands out: 

### 𝐏𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
 - At 21%, Pakistan spends the highest % of its budget on defense—more than the US and Russia. 
 - Context: Regional tensions and internal security challenges drive this focus. 

### 𝐑𝐮𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐚 & 𝐈𝐬𝐫𝐚𝐞𝐥’𝐬 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
 - Russia (18.52%) and Israel (18.76%) reflect sustained militarization due to geopolitical threats (Ukraine war, Middle East conflicts). 

### 𝐔𝐒 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: 𝐀𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐯𝐬. 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞
 - While the US spends 17.20% (lower than Pakistan or Israel), its total defense budget dwarfs others (~$800B in 2024). 

### 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐚’𝐬 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
 - Only 6.51% —but with a massive economy, this still funds the world’s 2nd-largest military. 
 - Key takeaway: China prioritizes infrastructure and tech over brute force. 

### 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 & 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚: 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
 - France (4.19%) and India (13.69%) show divergent paths: France leans on EU/NATO alliances, while India faces dual threats (China/Pakistan). 

#### 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬
- High defense spending can crowd out education/healthcare (e.g., Pakistan spends 5x more on military than education). 
- Trade-offs define national resilience: China’s lower % fuels long-term growth; Israel’s high % ensures survival.
